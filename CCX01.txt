AMD's Ryzen 7 lower than expected performance in some applications seems to stem from a particular problem: 
memory. Before AMD's Ryzen chips were even out, reports pegged AMD as having confirmed that most of the tweaks
and programming for the new architecture had been done in order to improve core performance to its max - at the
expense of memory compatibility and performance. Apparently, and until AMD's entire Ryzen line-up is completed
with the upcoming Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 3 processors, the company will be hard at work on improving Ryzen's cache handling
and memory latency.

Hardware.fr has done a pretty good job in exploring Ryzen's cache and memory subsystem deficiencies through the use of AIDA 64,
in what would otherwise be an exceptional processor design. Namely, the fact that there seems to be some problem with Ryzen's L3
cache and memory subsystem implementation. Paired with the same memory configuration and at the same 3 GHz clocks, for instance,
Ryzen's memory tests show memory latency results that are up to 30 ns higher (at 90 ns) than the average latency found on Intel's
i7 6900K or even AMD's FX 8350 (both at around 60 ns).
